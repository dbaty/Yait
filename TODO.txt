- switch to repoze.who 2

- move to distribute

- PEP 8 naming

- find a new name: obal, peri, prao, aster, noria, etc.

- handle requests to "/robots.txt" (and possibly "/favicon.ico"
  if/when the laster template is not used)

- find (or write a tool) that runs tests, logs all SQL queries and
  runs EXPLAIN (or something similar) on each query. (?)

- automated tests + coverage

- project control panel : configure whether the public
  (customer-oriented) timing information is displayed ('time_billed'
  and 'time_spent_public').

- add a way to configure a project so that "time spent (real)" is
  required. In this case, display the field below the text field (and
  not in the "extra" field set).

- project control panel : grant a permission to user U;

- relationships between issues : parent/child, blocker/blocked

- site view ;

- project view ;

- add auto-complete widget for "assign issue to"

- review layout of the extra fieldset (?)

- profile and optimize:

  - repoze.profile

  - make Storm more verbose (display all requests)

- display date in the user's timezone:

  - http://www.onlineaspect.com/2007/06/08/auto-detect-a-time-zone-with-javascript

  - http://www.csgnetwork.com/timezoneproginfo.html

- document time-related details:

  - estimated time (internal): the time you think you are going to
    spend on this issue. This value is private and is not shown to the
    customer;

  - time billed: the time the customer is going to be billed. It may
    be equal to the estimated time, but could as well be less or more,
    depending on the context;

  - time spent (real): the time you have really spent on this issue;

  - time spent (public): the time spent on this issue as it should be
    seen by the customer. It may be different than the time really
    spent, and relates to the time billed.

- review footer (?).

- allow other text formatting syntaxes:

  - make the syntax configurable in the preferences (set in a cookie);

  - call the right renderer when previewing;

  - store the renderer in the Change model, along the text.

- when clicking on "show/hide extra", scroll to the end of the page so
  that the "update" button is visible. Use $.scrollTo(object) (cf. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo) or scrollTop() (?)

- a checkbox to assign "to me"

- add a way to change the title: quick edit (cf. issue tracker Pilot),
  or when adding a comment

- validate HTML, CSS and Javascript (jslint).

- CSS tweaks:

  - form errors: add formError in formRow. Cf. postaleo / Dolmen for
    example

- add a way to delete an issue. Actually, it should not remove
  anything. It toggles the "deleted" marker in the Issue model and add
  a change. The view page is specific and only indicates that this
  issue has been deleted, the author of the deletion and the
  date. Only project administrators are allowed to undelete an issue
  (which also adds a "Change" entry).

- user preferences:

  - markup syntax;

  - preferred language;

- show users' full name instead of their id.

- attachments

- optimize database

- protect from CSRF and XSS: check origin of form submission (with an
  hidden token);

- clean up comments (remove iframe, Javascript, etc.)

- search form

- e-mail notification

- i18n

- handle trailing slash after the name of a project

- better error handling (404 & 500)

- recent activity per project

- time reporting graphics

- add credit for icons: Tango (http://tango.freedesktop.org/), etc.

- when the text renderer gives an error, refuse to save the issue/comment;

- when the text renderer gives an error, show error outside of the
  text container.

- add favicon

- check "api.url_of()" when the URL looks like: domain.com/foo/yait

- add a "Component/category" field (à la Jira). Do we need that if we
  have tags?

- add tags

- show priority and deadline in different colors: orange if imminent,
  red if past.

- add settings so that the JSON calls are not cached:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/264216/getjson-returning-cached-data-in-ie8

- handle LDAP groups;

- user guide
