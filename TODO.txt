========

- complete the 'add issue' form:

  - add missing widgets

  - add a checkbox to assign "to me" in the extra fields of the add
    issue/comment form. Easier: add a "to me" link near the label,
    which will fill the field.

  - add a way to change the title: quick edit (cf. issue tracker
    Pilot), or when adding a comment

- review CSS:

  - show actions only on pages where it is sensible, i.e. on all pages
    except the control panel and the home page. On the home page, we
    should have a list of projects, though.

- design:

  - review "Text renderer" field: we could move it to a hidden field
    and have a custom drop-down menu on the right of the "Text label",
    like this:

      Text (using reStructuredText v)

    But this is too soon to spend time on this, as we have only one
    renderer for now. We should rather find a half-way solution

  - buttons are ugly

- relationships between issues : parent/child, blocker/blocked

- command-line tool to add a new user (really?)

- review permission system: turn it into a Pyramid authorization
  policy (?)

- check "Add admin" interface. It should just provide a selection
  widget to pick an existing user.

- attachments

- home page:

  - list of issues assigned to me

  - list of issues that I am watching

  - recent activity (later?)

- project home page:

  - list of issues assigned to me

  - list of issues that I am watching

  - recent activity (later?)

  - link to a graphical representation of tickets (down to a certain
    depth) : later

- project configuration : configure whether the public
  (customer-oriented) timing information is displayed ('time_billed'
  and 'time_spent_public').

- add a way to configure a project so that "time spent (real)" is
  required. In this case, display the field below the text field (and
  not in the "extra" field set).

- search form

- e-mail notification:

  1. Issue added:

    - the reporter is subscribed;

    - send notification to the reporter and the list of automatically
      notified users (configured per project).

  2. Issue updated: send notification to the list of subscribers.

  3. Subscriber added: send notification to the list of subscribers
     and the new subscriber (same as #2 above)

  IssueSubscription: issue_id, user_id

  ProjectSubscription: project_id, user_id

- i18n (and update Trove classifier in 'setup.py')

- sanitize user input comments (remove iframe, Javascript, etc.) :
  https://github.com/jsocol/bleach ?

- anti-CSRF measures:
  http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/docs/dev/ext.html#module-wtforms.ext.csrf

- add auto-complete widget for "assign issue to"

- add auto-complete widget for "Parent issue"

- remove "Child issue(s)" label from the extra fieldset

- make status, priority and kind fields configurable.

- find a new name: obal, peri, prao, aster, noria, falgo, tern, tuit

- project control panel : grant a permission to user U:

  User/permission   Administer  View  Participate  See private info
  ===============   ==========  ====  ===========  ================
    john.smith          o         o       o               o
       ...
   <input field>        o         o       o               o

=====

- speed up tests

- ability to guess links to issues in comments, for example::

      See issue #123 and issue #project-something:123. This is our
      priority ##1.

- ability to deactivate a user: such a user will not be able to login
  anymore, be assigned an issue nor receive any e-mail
  notifications. Perhaps we could store an history pickle in a
  separate table that logs account creation, deactivation and
  reactivation.

- allow other text formatting syntaxes:

  - make the syntax configurable in the preferences (set in a cookie);

  - call the right renderer when previewing;

  - store the renderer in the Change model, alongside the text.

- handle requests to "/robots.txt" (and possibly "/favicon.ico"
  if/when the layout template is not used)

- display date in the user's timezone:

  - http://www.onlineaspect.com/2007/06/08/auto-detect-a-time-zone-with-javascript

  - http://www.csgnetwork.com/timezoneproginfo.html

- document time-related details:

  - estimated time (internal): the time you think you are going to
    spend on this issue. This value is private and is not shown to the
    customer;

  - time billed: the time the customer is going to be billed. It may
    be equal to the estimated time, but could as well be less or more,
    depending on the context;

  - time spent (real): the time you have really spent on this issue;

  - time spent (public): the time spent on this issue as it should be
    seen by the customer. It may be different than the time really
    spent, and relates to the time billed.

  - try to make it more clear in the UI itself that "estimated time"
    and "time billed" fields correspond to a total (that will replace
    previous values), while "time spent" (private and public) will be
    added (or possibly removed) to the total time already spent on
    this issue.

- validate HTML, CSS and Javascript (jslint).

- add a way to delete an issue. Actually, it should not remove
  anything. It toggles the "deleted" marker in the Issue model and add
  a change. The view page is specific and only indicates that this
  issue has been deleted, the author of the deletion and the
  date. Only project administrators are allowed to undelete an issue
  (which also adds a "Change" entry).

- user preferences:

  - markup syntax;

  - preferred language;

- show users' full name instead of their id.

- optimize database

- better error handling (404 & 500)

- time reporting graphics

- add credit for icons: Tango (http://tango.freedesktop.org/), etc.

- when the text renderer gives an error, refuse to save the issue/comment;

- when the text renderer gives an error, show error outside of the
  text container.

- add favicon

- add tags

- show priority and deadline in different colors: orange if imminent,
  red if past.

- add settings so that the JSON calls are not cached:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/264216/getjson-returning-cached-data-in-ie8

- user guide

- automatically grow textareas: http://www.technoreply.com/autogrow-textarea-plugin-version-2-0/

- handle localization of timing information: "1j" in French should be
  turned into "1d" in English.
