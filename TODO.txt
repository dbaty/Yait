- automated tests + coverage

- check 'commit_veto()'

- review "issue properties" panel. It is confused.

- display date in the user's timezone:

  - http://www.onlineaspect.com/2007/06/08/auto-detect-a-time-zone-with-javascript

  - http://www.csgnetwork.com/timezoneproginfo.html

- add a way to configure a project so that "time spent (real)" is
  required. In this case, display the field below the text field (and
  not in the "extra" field set).

- use an existing form rendering/marshalling package

- document time-related details:

  - estimated time (internal): the time you think you are going to
    spend on this issue. This value is private and not shown to the
    customer;

  - time billed: the time the customer is going to be billed. It may
    be equal to the estimated time, but could as well be less or more,
    depending on the context;

  - time spent (real): the time you have truly spent on this issue;

  - time spent (public): the time spent on this issue as it should be
    seen by the customer. It may be different than the time really
    spent, and relates to the time billed.

- complete issue_add_form with additional metadata

- complete issue_view ("add comment" form) with additional metadata

- relationships between issues : parent/child, blocker/blocked

- new button: "add new issue" in issue_view, under the properties
  panel. Drop-down menu with "add issue", "add sub-issue" or "add
  sibling issue". Or shall we add this in the new toolbox bar? On the
  other hand, this toolbox bar may not be that useful. The login link
  may very well appear elsewhere, for example in the footer. Actually,
  where will the search box appear? In the header, aligned to the
  right?

- allow other text formatting syntaxes:

  - make the syntax configurable (set in a cookie);

  - call the right renderer when previewing;

  - store the renderer in the Change model, along the text.

- when clicking on "show/hide extra", scroll to the end of the page so
  that the "update" button is visible. (use $.scrollTo(object) ? cf. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo)

- for each project: configure whether the public (customer-oriented)
  timing information is displayed ('time_billed' and
  'time_spent_public').

- a checkbox to assign "to me"

- add a way to change the title: quick edit (cf. issue tracker Pilot),
  or when adding a comment

- on each project:

  - grant a permission to user U;

  - grant a permission to group G (from LDAP).

- validate HTML, CSS and Javascript (jslint)

- CSS tweaks:

  - form errors: add formError in formRow. Cf. postaleo / Dolmen for
    example

- add a way to delete an issue. Actually, it does not remove
  anything. It toggles the "deleted" marker in the Issue model and add
  a change. The view page is specific and only indicates that this
  issue has been deleted, the author of the deletion and the
  date. Only project administrators are allowed to undelete an issue
  (which also adds a "Change" entry).

- user preferences:

  - markup syntax;

  - preferred language;

  - order in which changes are shown: chronologically or
    anti-chronologically

- global control panel to define managers and create projects;

- show users' full name instead of their id.

- attachments

- "paster setup-app <file.ini>" could be used to initialize the
  database

- optimize database

- protect from CSRF and XSS: check origin of form submission (with an
  hidden token), clean up comments (remove iframe, Javascript, etc.)

- search

- e-mail notification

- i18n

- better error handling (404 & 500)

- recent activity per project

- time reporting graphics

- add credit for icons: Tango (http://tango.freedesktop.org/), etc.

- when the text renderer gives an error, refuse to save the issue/comment;

- when the text renderer gives an error, show error outside of the
  text container.

- add favicon

- check "api.urlOf()" when the URL looks like: domain.com/foo/yait

- add a "Component/category" field (à la Jira)
