- use HTTPSeeOther to redirect after a POST (instead of HTTPFound)

- review permission system: turn it into a Pyramid authorization
  policy (?)

- speed up tests

- check "Add admin" interface. It should just provide a selection
  widget to pick an existing user.

- add a command-line tool to add a new user


Yait 0.2
========

- review CSS:

  - "Update by xxx" header should probably be smaller, or with a
     background-color different from the text of the comment itself)

  - move actions (add issue, search issue, configure project, etc.) in
    an horizontal bar below the title header.

  - move "meta" bar to the left column (?)

- complete the 'add issue' form

- add a way to change the title: quick edit (cf. issue tracker Pilot),
  or when adding a comment

- add a checkbox to assign "to me" in the extra fields of the add
  issue/comment form. Easier: add a "to me" link near the label, which
  will fill the field.

- attachments

- home page

- project home page:

  - last 10 added or updated issues;

  - "master tickets" (if feature is implemented)

  - reorganize "add issue" and "configure project" buttons (move to
    the action bar below the title?)

- relationships between issues : parent/child, blocker/blocked

- project control panel : configure whether the public
  (customer-oriented) timing information is displayed ('time_billed'
  and 'time_spent_public').

- add a way to configure a project so that "time spent (real)" is
  required. In this case, display the field below the text field (and
  not in the "extra" field set).

- check "api.url_of()" when the URL looks like: domain.com/foo/yait
  (should not be a problem if we use 'route_url()').

- search form

- e-mail notification:

  1. Issue added:

    - the reporter is subscribed;

    - send notification to the reporter and the list of automatically
      notified users (configured per project).

  2. Issue updated: send notification to the list of subscribers.

  3. Subscriber added: send notification to the list of subscribers
     and the new subscriber (same as #2 above)

  IssueSubscription: issue_id, user_id

  ProjectSubscription: project_id, user_id

- i18n

- sanitize user input comments (remove iframe, Javascript, etc.) : https://github.com/jsocol/bleach ?

- make sure that use POST instead of 'request.params' when it is fit

- anti-CSRF measures: http://wtforms.simplecodes.com/docs/dev/ext.html#module-wtforms.ext.csrf

- anti-XSS measures

- add auto-complete widget for "assign issue to"

- add auto-complete widget for "Parent issue"

- remove "Child issue(s)" label from the extra fieldset



Yait 0.3
========

- switch to repoze.who 2

- move to distribute

- PEP 8 naming, including in tests ('_makeRequst', etc.)

- find a new name: obal, peri, prao, aster, noria, falgo, tern, tuit



Yait 0.4
========

- project control panel : grant a permission to user U:

  User/permission   Administer  View  Participate  See private info
  ===============   ==========  ====  ===========  ================
    john.smith          o         o       o               o
       ...
   <input field>        o         o       o               o

- review layout of the extra fieldset (?)

- review footer (?).


Later
=====

- ability to guess links to issues in comments, for example::

      See issue #123 and issue #project-something:123. This is our
      priority ##1.

- ability to deactivate a user: such a user will not be able to login
  anymore, be assigned an issue nor receive any e-mail
  notifications. Perhaps we could store an history pickle in a
  separate table that logs account creation, deactivation and
  reactivation.

- make status, priority and kind fields configurable.

- allow other text formatting syntaxes:

  - make the syntax configurable in the preferences (set in a cookie);

  - call the right renderer when previewing;

  - store the renderer in the Change model, along the text.

- when clicking on "show/hide extra", scroll to the end of the page so
  that the "update" button is visible. Use $.scrollTo(object) (cf. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/ScrollTo) or scrollTop() (?)

- find (or write a tool) that runs tests, logs all SQL queries and
  runs EXPLAIN (or something similar) on each query. (?)

- handle requests to "/robots.txt" (and possibly "/favicon.ico"
  if/when the laster template is not used)

- profile and optimize:

  - repoze.profile

- display date in the user's timezone:

  - http://www.onlineaspect.com/2007/06/08/auto-detect-a-time-zone-with-javascript

  - http://www.csgnetwork.com/timezoneproginfo.html

- document time-related details:

  - estimated time (internal): the time you think you are going to
    spend on this issue. This value is private and is not shown to the
    customer;

  - time billed: the time the customer is going to be billed. It may
    be equal to the estimated time, but could as well be less or more,
    depending on the context;

  - time spent (real): the time you have really spent on this issue;

  - time spent (public): the time spent on this issue as it should be
    seen by the customer. It may be different than the time really
    spent, and relates to the time billed.

  - try to make it more clear in the UI itself that "estimated time"
    and "time billed" fields correspond to a total (that will replace
    previous values), while "time spent" (private and public) will be
    added (or possibly removed) to the total time already spent on
    this issue.

- validate HTML, CSS and Javascript (jslint).

- CSS tweaks:

  - form errors: add formError in formRow. Cf. postaleo / Dolmen for
    example

  - when the text of the issue is very short, the actions ('add
    issue', 'search issues', 'configure project') appears in the
    footer.

- add a way to delete an issue. Actually, it should not remove
  anything. It toggles the "deleted" marker in the Issue model and add
  a change. The view page is specific and only indicates that this
  issue has been deleted, the author of the deletion and the
  date. Only project administrators are allowed to undelete an issue
  (which also adds a "Change" entry).

- user preferences:

  - markup syntax;

  - preferred language;

- show users' full name instead of their id.

- optimize database

- handle trailing slash after the name of a project

- better error handling (404 & 500)

- recent activity per project

- time reporting graphics

- add credit for icons: Tango (http://tango.freedesktop.org/), etc.

- when the text renderer gives an error, refuse to save the issue/comment;

- when the text renderer gives an error, show error outside of the
  text container.

- add favicon

- add a "Component/category" field (à la Jira). Do we need that if we
  have tags?

- add tags

- show priority and deadline in different colors: orange if imminent,
  red if past.

- add settings so that the JSON calls are not cached:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/264216/getjson-returning-cached-data-in-ie8

- handle LDAP groups;

- user guide
