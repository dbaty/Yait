YAIT
====

Yait is an issue tracking software written in Python with
`repoze.bfg`_. It is open source and fully tested (100% test coverage)
and documented. It is fast. It has an attractive and straightforward
user interface. It provides a very convenient yet rather infrequent
feature that lets one create hierarchies of issues (tasks, sub-tasks
and so on) that may also be used to manage milestones or versions.

Why *another* issue tracker
===========================

The author has used several different issue tracking systems and have
been slightly disappointed by most of them. Some have an user
interface that is too complex, some are shipping with too much
unneeded features. And, more importantly, none have the possibility to
create hierarchies of issues, which was a required feature.


Contribute
==========

Contributions are most welcome. The source code lives in a Subversion
repository. It is not planned to use GitHub, BitBucket or a similar
publicly available DVCS repository.


Credits
=======

Several ideas have been borrowed from an issue tracker developped by
`Pilot Systems`_ on top of the Zope IssueTracker product. Other ideas
were naturally picked up here and there in other issue tracking
softwares.

This software would not exist without the tremendous work deployed by
Chris McDonough and others on `repoze.bfg`_, the web framework Yait is
built with.

The following persons have contributed to Yait:
