YAIT

FIXME: review

Yait is an issue tracking software written in Python with
`Pyramid`_. It is open source, fully tested (100% test coverage)
and documented. It is fast. It has an attractive and straightforward
user interface. It provides a very convenient feature that lets one
create hierarchies of issues (tasks, sub-tasks and so on) that may
also be used to manage project milestones or software versions.

FIXME: to be expanded/rewritten: i18n, easy to install, etc.

Why *another* issue tracker
===========================

The author has used different issue tracking systems and have been
slightly disappointed by most of them. Some have an user interface
that is too complex, some are shipping with too much unneeded
features. And, more importantly, none had the possibility to create
hierarchies of issues, which was a required feature. Also, they come
with the wrong colors.

Credits and license
===================

Several ideas have been borrowed from an issue tracker developped by
`Pilot Systems`_ on top of the Zope `IssueTracker`_ product. Other
ideas were naturally picked up here and there in other issue tracking
softwares.

This software would not exist without the tremendous work deployed by
Chris McDonough and others on `Pyramid`_, the web framework Yait is
built upon.
